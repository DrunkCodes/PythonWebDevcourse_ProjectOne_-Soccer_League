# PythonWebDevcourse_ProjectOne_-Soccer_League
This is my Python Web Developer course project one at Treehouse..
This python script gets data from the soccer_league csv file and add it to three teams evenly according to their experience .
It also converts it to a text file and also adds it to teams.txt so that someone can view the league roster on a txt file and see
how the teams have being grouped according to their experince.
